# HideFiles
The most cool way to hide the files

Archive the entire folder with your files to the zip or rar archive.
Place any picture you want and the created archive in one folder.In my case C:\hidden\
Press Win + R, enter cmd and press Enter.
At the commandLine, navigate to the folder where the archive and photo are placed using the cd command, for example: cd C:\hidden\
Enter the following command (the filenames are taken from my example, the first file is the your image, the second is the archive in which the folder or files are located, the third is the new image file(Fake image)) 
<b>COPY/B anyimage.jpg + myFolderWithFiles.rar secret-image.jpg<b>
After the commandline is finished, try to open the created file secret-image.jpg - the same image will open, which was in the first image. However, if we open the same file through the archiver, or rename it to rar or zip, then when we open it we will see our secret files.
Good Luck!:)
